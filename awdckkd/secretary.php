						<p>We have tried to bridge the gap  between the academics and the corporate. We have taken the need of an increased focus on functional knowledge, in accordance with the demands of the corporate sector into consideration.  We have received  guidance form eminent personalities, from our board of studies for desning the course content as per the expectancies and skills required by corporate, in different areas.</p>

<p>The Adityan invests here his latent talent in his development process of his career. We also see our students as future  leaders in the  coming years and definitely ensure to show a successful path to them.</p>

On behalf of Aditya Degree Colleges, it's a great pleasure for me to invite you all for our college which will be the first step towards Academia Corporate tie up.</p>
