						<p>Organic  Chemistry is the study of structures, properties and reactions of organic  compounds and organic materials.</p>
<p>The range of applications of organic  compounds is enormous and organic chemistry overlaps with many areas including  medicinal chemistry, bio-chemistry, organometallic chemistry, polymer  chemistry, analytical chemistry, synthetic chemistry and many aspects of  material science.</p>
<p>In the modern society, knowledge  with organic chemistry is required within a wide range of disciplines, as  organic synthetic products serve as plastics, drugs, pharmaceuticals,  pesticides, nano materials, food additives, pigments, flavourings, fibres,  clothing petrochemicals, paints and environment aspects. Additionally organic  chemistry deals with life and life process in study of &nbsp;key molecules of life such as DNA, proteins,  lipids and carbohydrates, are organic compounds, furnishing the energy that  sustains life. </p>
