						<p>Microbiologists need at least a bachelor's degree in microbiology. Many colleges and universities offer degree programs in biological sciences, including microbiology.</p>
<p>Most microbiology majors take core courses in food microbiology and medical microbiology and elective classes such as environmental microbiology and virology. Students also must take classes in other sciences, such as botany , zoology ,Bacteriology , Proto zoology, Virology.</p>
<p>because it is important for microbiologists to have a broad understanding of the sciences. It is important for prospective microbiologists to have laboratory experience before entering the workforce. Most undergraduate microbiology programs include a mandatory laboratory requirement, but additional laboratory coursework is recommended. Students also can gain valuable laboratory experience through internships with prospective employers such as drug manufacturers.</p>
<p>Microbiologists typically need a Ph.D. to carry out independent research and work in colleges and universities. Graduate students studying microbiology commonly specialize in a subfield such as bacteriology or immunology. Ph.D. programs usually include class work, laboratory research, and completing a thesis or dissertation</p>
