						<p>Analytical  Chemistry is a scientific discipline that develops and applies methods,  instruments and strategies to obtain information on the composition and nature  of matter.<br>
  Analytical  chemistry has applications including in forensic science, bioanalysis, clinical  analysis, environmental analysis, pharmaceutical and drug analysis, soil  analysis, ore analysis and material analysis.</p>
<p>Analytical chemistry has played  critical roles in the understanding of basic science to a variety of practical  applications such as biomedical applications, environmental monitoring and  quality control of industrial manufacturing. Analytical chemistry has been as  indispensable area in the development of nanotechnology, Surface  characterization instruments, electron microscopes and scanning probe  microscopes enables scientists to visualize atomic structures with chemical  characterizations.</p>
