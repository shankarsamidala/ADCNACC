						<p>Aditya Degree colleges are the precious gifts presented to the twin Godavari Districts by ADITYA Educational Group. ADITYA Degree College which was established in 1998 in Kakinada fulfilled the hopes and aspirations of many graduates and had been acclaimed as the best degree college under Andhra University.  Encouraged by the 100% result in 2003,ADITYA added several feathers to its cap by launching Degree Colleges in Rajahmundry in 2003, in Vizag and Palakol in 2005 and in Tatipaka in 2006.</p>

<p>Needless to say, in the present scenario girls excel more than boys in education and they give tough competition to boys. Owing to their diffidence and inhibition, girls find difficulty in expressing their doubts in a classroom of Co-ed College. Moreover, parents have many objections in sending their daughters to a co-ed college. Realizing this, ADITYA successfully leads Degree colleges for girls to prove their talents in curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. ADITYA started P.G College also for Women to encourage them for higher education.</p>
